# Hanji Android App
This is the source code for the Android app [Hanji](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a494studios.koreanconjugator&hl=en).

Source code for Hanji's server backend can be found [here](https://github.com/Ninjaman494/Hanji-Server).

The old 1.0 version of Hanji used the db found [here](https://github.com/garfieldnate/kengdic), but now it uses a custom MongoDB.

**Note:** This repo does not include API keys and other sensitive information used by Hanji. If you try to build this repo **it will not work**.
